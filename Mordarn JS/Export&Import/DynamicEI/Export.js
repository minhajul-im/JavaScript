///Dynamic export refers to conditionally exporting different values from a module based on certain conditions or runtime logic. While dynamic export is not a native feature of JavaScript, it can be achieved using techniques like using a function to determine the exported value or using an object to conditionally include properties.

export const sum = (a) => a + a;

export const sub = (a) => a - a;

export const multi = (a) => a * a;
