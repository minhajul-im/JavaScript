//You can export various elements (variables, functions, classes, objects) from a module using named exports or default exports. Named exports allow you to export multiple values, each with a specific name, while default exports export a single value that can be imported with any name

export const plus = (a) => a + a;

export const minus = (a) => a - a;

export const multi = (a) => a * a;
