What is null? 
"null" is a special value that represents an empty or unknown value.
null type of object.

When a variable is assigned to null, it means that the variable has no value or points to no object. It is often used to represent a non-existent or invalid object or value. For example, if you have a variable that should point to an object but you don't have an object to assign to it, you can initialize the variable to null to indicate that it does not currently point to any object.
